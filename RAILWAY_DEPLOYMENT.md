# WhisperLive Railway Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy WhisperLive to Railway for stable, cloud-hosted speech-to-text transcription.

## üöÄ Quick Deploy to Railway

### Step 1: Prepare Repository
The deployment files are already created:
- ‚úÖ `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- ‚úÖ `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- ‚úÖ `Procfile` - Startup command

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway

**Option A: One-Click Deploy**
[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/WhisperLive)

**Option B: Manual Deploy**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up/login
2. Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Connect your GitHub account and select this WhisperLive repository
4. Railway will automatically detect Python and deploy using our configuration

### Step 3: Configure Environment (Optional)
In Railway dashboard, you can set these environment variables:
- `WHISPER_MODEL` - Model to use (default: small)
- `MAX_CLIENTS` - Maximum concurrent clients (default: 4)
- `MAX_CONNECTION_TIME` - Max connection time in seconds (default: 600)

### Step 4: Get Your Railway URL
After deployment, Railway will provide a URL like:
`https://your-app-name.railway.app`

## üîß Update Church Translator Configuration

Update your `.env` file in ChurchTranslator:
```env
WHISPERLIVE_HOST=your-app-name.railway.app
WHISPERLIVE_PORT=443
```

Or use the configuration function to point to your Railway deployment.

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- **Always Online**: 24/7 availability
- **Auto-scaling**: Handles multiple users
- **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks
- **SSL**: Secure HTTPS connections
- **No Local Setup**: No need to run Python server locally

## üîç Monitoring

Check your deployment:
- Railway Dashboard: Monitor CPU, memory, logs
- Health Check: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/health`
- WebSocket Test: Connect to `wss://your-app-name.railway.app`

## üí∞ Cost

Railway offers:
- **Free Tier**: $5 credit monthly (good for development)
- **Pro Plan**: $20/month for production use
- **Usage-based**: Pay only for what you use

## üîß Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check Railway logs in the dashboard
2. Verify requirements.txt has all needed packages
3. Ensure run_server.py accepts --port argument
4. Contact Railway support for platform issues

## üéØ Next Steps

Once deployed:
1. Update Church Translator to use Railway URL
2. Test transcription with your React Native app
3. Consider upgrading to custom fine-tuned model
4. Monitor usage and performance in Railway dashboard
